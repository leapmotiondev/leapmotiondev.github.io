# What's a "Network"?

... tbd.

# What Protocols are usually used?

## TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol):

Pros:
- Connection-oriented, connects with the receiving device before transmitting data.
- Reliable; guarantees delivery to the receiving device.
- Checks for errors in data packets.
- Sequenced, packets arrive in-order at the receiving device.
- Contains flow control protocol, guarantees deliverer does not overwhelm receiver with data.

Cons:
- Slower than UDP due to extra duties.
- Unable to execute broadcasting tasks.

Common Uses:
   Email
- World Wide Web (HTTP, HTTPS)
- Generally, applications that call for high reliability where speed is the primary concern.


## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Pros:
- Faster than TCP.
- Simple in its transmission, limited data management.
- Supports broadcasting tasks.

Cons:
- Unreliable, cannot guarantee packet delivery due to being datagram-oriented rather than connection-oriented.
- No retransmission of lost data packets.
- Minimal error checking.
- No sequencing, packets may arrive out of order.
- Can overload the receiver, only stops sending data once the task is completed.

Common Uses:
- Video Streaming
- Online Gaming
- Generally, applications that rely on the speed of data reception.
